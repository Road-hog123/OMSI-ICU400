# Mobitec ICU400 Sign Controller for OMSI 2

Around the release of Addon London 1.02, the commented scripts, source model files and documentation will be released here under the Apache 2.0 license.

Until then I have released [a package](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yhk6zmhdryxhv8a/AoL_1.01_Compatibility-Resources.zip?dl=1) containing the scripts, textures and source model files for making a vehicle compatible with Addon London version 1.01 HOF files.
